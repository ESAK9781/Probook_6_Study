# About OpenStudy

OpenStudy is a framework I designed to have a lot of the same functionality as Quizlet, except it is open source, add-free, and free to use. It is a long-running side-project of mine, and I have been writing on it off and on for the last three years.

Because it is such a long-running project, it has several issues:
-   It has no documentation statement, because I was not writing this for any project.
-   It is too late to add documentation statements, because I do not remember what I used.
-   I may have copied several lines of code from StackOverflow, and I have no clue which lines they were.

As a result, I am including this here just as I would any other module or library. I ask that it not be included in the grading, because it is just a tool to view the outputs of my actual program -- the question generator -- and enables it to be viewn on a web browser. My project is the question generator, and this is just one of my project's dependencies. While the vast majority of it is my original work and code, I cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that all of it is, and I am not looking for any credit for it, just for the question generating python system that I wrote under the parameters of this the Final Project.

The OpenStudy modules I reference encompass everything in the OpenStudy_Module folder, as well as any folders that have been directly copied from that folder throughout the course of the program.
